Hey! Thanks for picking up WulfsGames.com's Auto-Reedemer app.

Please follow the next steps to use the redeemer:

1. Install node for your operating system: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Run install.bat
3. Edit config.json with the desired account's credentials

Activating games automatically can be done in two ways: 
- add games codes to your games.txt file
- send messages (from the set up ID64 in the config.json file) to your bot, and it will auto-redeem them

The keys MUST be formatted like this:
a) XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX 
b) Game Name | XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
* The sepparator must be '|'

After you've set up and double checked everything, run start.bat and you're good to go.

:)
